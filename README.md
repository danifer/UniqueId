UniqueId
========
A unique ID generator.

Why?
---
I built this project to get some experience using github. It's a simple, open API designed to generate a unique ID on request. You might use this if you have multiple applications that need globally unique IDs across instances.

Basically, it's for when auto increment IDs aren't cutting it anymore.

Infrastructure
--------------
Symfony, Twitter bootstrap, and Doctrine
